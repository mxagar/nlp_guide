    "### Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of machine learning techniques are divided in these groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supervised Learning: regression and classification with labelled data\n",
    "- Unsupervised Learning: clustering, anomaly detection and dimenstionality reduction with unlabelled data\n",
    "- Reinforcement Learning: learning through actions with the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "We have labelled or annotated samples, which are split\n",
    "- Training split: train model parameters.\n",
    "- Validation split: for adjusting hyperparameters (skipped in the course).\n",
    "- Test split: final performance metric; nothing tested anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually two types of problems are solved:\n",
    "- Classification: predict the class of a new sample using a model trained with labelled samples.\n",
    "- Regression: predict the continuous value of a sample using a model trained with labelled samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised learning\n",
    "We don't have labelled data.\n",
    "Usually these kind of problems are solved:\n",
    "- Clustering: data points are grouped due to their similarity; since data is not labelled, the grouping can result to be artificial, if not correctly done.\n",
    "- Anomaly detection: we detect outliers in a dataset, eg, fraud detection; usually we don't have outliers as data, but we recognize them when they appear.\n",
    "- Dimensionality reduction: the number of features of each sample can be reduced either to compress or to better understand the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don't have labels (ground truth), we cannot evaluate the methods that easily."
