## 0. Setup

I installed the following packages/libraries in the environments `ds` and `tf`, which already contained many of the other requirements:

```bash
conda activate ds
conda install spacy keras nltk
conda activate tf
conda install spacy keras nltk
```

However, a YAML with the requirements to create a new conda environment is provided:

`./utils/nlp_course_env.yml`

This is its content:

```yml

  - defaults
