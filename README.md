# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Guide

This is my guide on Natural Language Processing (NLP) structured after following the Udemy course [NLP - Natural Language Processing with Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/nlp-natural-language-processing-with-python/) by José Marcial Portilla.

I've done several courses by JM Portilla in the last years and he's a great content creator; his videos are very practical. The intuition of the theoretical concepts is briefly provided and practical coding is explained. I often look for more theoretical insights in papers and text books, but that's not necessary in practice, unless one wants to carry out research.

Note that I would have forked the original repository to add notes, but the material is provided with a download link.

The file [`NLP_Guide.md`](NLP_Guide.md) provides a general guide of the course and points out to the different notebooks of each section:

0. Setup
1. Python Text Basics
2. NLP Basics
3. Part of Speech Tagging & Named Entity Recognition
4. Text Classification
5. Semantics and Sentiment Analysis
6. Topic Modeling
7. Deep Learning for NLP
8. Text Embeddings

Besides of that:

- `./utils/` contains any utility files, such as the requirements YAML.
- `./pics/` contains pictures used in the guide.
- `./data/` contains texts and datasets.

Finally, here is a list of interesting links:

- My repository on **text embeddings** and some quick applications: [tool_guides/sbert](https://github.com/mxagar/tool_guides/tree/master/sbert).
