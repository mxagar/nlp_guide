# NLP Guide

A guide on Natural Language Processing (NLP) structured after following the Udemy course [NLP - Natural Language Processing with Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/nlp-natural-language-processing-with-python/) by Jos√© Marcial Portilla.

I've done several courses by Portilla in the last years and he's a great content creator; his videos are very practical. The intuition of the theoretical concepts is briefly provided and practical coding is explained. I often look for more theoretical insights in papers and text books, but that's not necessary in practice, unless one wants to carry out research.

Note that I would have forked the original repository to add notes, but the material is provided with a download link.

My notes file 

`NLP_Guide.md`

provides a general guide of the course and points out to the different notebooks of each section:

0. Setup
2. Python Text Basics
3. NLP Basics
4. Part of Speech Tagging & Named Entity Recognition
5. Text Classification
6. Semantics and Sentiment Analysis
7. Topic Modeling
8. Deep Learning for NLP

Besides of that:

- `./utils/` contains any utility files, such as the requirements' YAML.
- `./pics/` contains pictures used in the guide.
- `./data/` contains texts and datasets.
